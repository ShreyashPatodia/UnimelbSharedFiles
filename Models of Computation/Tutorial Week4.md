By negating a satisfiable proposition:

## 1. it's impossible to get a tautology
Because a proposition is valid iff its negation is unsatisfiable.

## 2. it's possible to get a satisfiable proposition.
By definition, satisfiable just means that there exists a valuation which makes the proposition true. While the proposition still can have a valuation that makes it evaluate to false, its negation is possible to be a satisfiable proposition.

## 3. it's possible to get a contradiction.
If this satisfiable proposition is valid, then its negation is a contradiction.
